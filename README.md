# Ariel's ZShell configuration

## Intro and Basics

* Based on ZShell:ZI
* This repository should be cloned to `$HOME/.config/zsh` (a.k.a. `$ZDOTDIR`)
* To enable the configuration, symlink `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv` to `$HOME/.zshenv`
* These locations can be changed by modifying the variables in `.zshenv` (not recommended)
* The rest of the configuration is self-deployed during the first run
