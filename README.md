# Ariel's ZShell configuration

* Based on ZShell:ZI
* All files should be located in `$HOME/.config/zsh`
* To enable the configuration, `$HOME/.config/zsh/.zshenv` needs to be symlinked to `$HOME/.zshenv`
* The base directory can be modified by adjusting the `ZDOTDIR` variable in `.zshenv` (Not tested thoroughly)
* The rest of the configuration is self-deployed during the first run
